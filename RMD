# Matt's Cool RMD File

## Collatz Conjecture

Unsolved and infamous, it asks if repeating two simple arithmetic operations every number eventually becomes 0:

If the number is even, divide it by two. If the number is odd

The following is a histogram of the distribution of the first 10,000 stopping numbers:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
collatz <- function(n, counter = -1) {
counter = counter + 1
if (n == 1) {
return(counter)
} else if (n %% 2 == 0) {
return(collatz((n / 2), counter))
} else {
return(collatz((3 * n + 1), counter))
}
}

start_values <- 1:100

iterations <- sapply(start_values, collatz)

hist(iterations, breaks = 20, main = "Collatz Sequence Iterations", xlab = "Iterations", ylab = "Frequency")
```

## What we can learn from Diamond Data

If we plot price frequency and carat frequency we can see that as the carat increases so does the rarity. Most diamonds are small, with 3 and 2.3 - 2.6 being the most common values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#| fig.cap = "Histogram of Diamond Prices",
#| fig.pos = "H",
#| fig.width = 5

ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = price)
) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

data("diamonds")
 
carat_data <- diamonds$carat
 
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
    geom_histogram(
         binwidth = 0.05,  
         fill = "blue",
         color = "black"
     ) +
     labs(
         title = "Carat Distribution Between 51787 Samples",
         x = "carat",
         y = "Frequency"
     ) +
     xlim(2, 5) + 
     ylim(0, 30)
```

## What we learned:

The value of this course to me does not come in the knowledge I have in R as I will likely not be using it in the future. It comes as the fundamentals developed this semester. I knew how to program before and have taken several computer science classes; however, none of my previous professors have been as careful and detail oriented as Neil. I feel like I'm already using the thinking programming culture that I have learned in Stat 184 in other classes.
